// Your tasks:
// 1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called 'EV') as a child
// "class" of 'Car'. Besides a make and current speed, the 'EV' also has the
// current battery charge in % ('charge' property)
// 2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument
// 'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo'
// 3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20,
// and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140
// km/h, with a charge of 22%'
// 4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate',
// 'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when
// you 'accelerate'! Hint: Review the definiton of polymorphism �
// Test data:
// § Data car 1: 'Tesla' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%

const Car = function (make, speed) {
  this.make = make;
  this.speed = speed;
};

Car.prototype.brake = function () {
  this.speed = this.speed - 5;
  console.log(`${this.make} is going at ${this.speed}km/h`);
};

const EV = function (make, speed, charge) {
  Car.call(this, make, speed);
  this.charge = charge;
};
EV.prototype = Object.create(Car.prototype);

EV.prototype.chargeBattery = function (chargeTo) {
  this.charge = chargeTo;
};
EV.prototype.brake = function () {
  this.speed = this.speed - 20;
  this.charge++;
  console.log(
    `speed of car ${this.speed} and charge at this point ${this.charge}`
  );
};
const tesle = new EV('Tesla', 120, 23);
console.log(tesle);
tesle.chargeBattery(90);
console.log(tesle);
tesle.brake();
